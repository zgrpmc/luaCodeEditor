# luaCodeEditor
This project is based on unknownworlds/decoda and dansen/luacode.

My modifications were:

1. Added supporting for customized API definitions from text files.
2. Enhanced autocompletion for customized APIs.
3. Hided debug windows, and optimized project explorer displaying.

My modifications just concerned on files in src/FontEnd folder comparing to dansen/luacode project.
